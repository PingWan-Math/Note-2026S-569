  abstract = {We consider two manifestations of non-positive curvature: acylindrical actions (on hyperbolic spaces) and quasigeodesic stability. We study these properties for the class of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, which is a general framework for simultaneously studying many important families of groups, including mapping class groups, right-angled Coxeter groups, most                                                                        3                     3                                                                  --manifold groups, right-angled Artin groups, and many others.                          A group that admits an acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space may admit many such actions on different hyperbolic spaces. It is natural to try to develop an understanding of all such actions and to search for a ``best'' one. The set of all cobounded acylindrical actions on hyperbolic spaces admits a natural poset structure, and in this paper we prove that all hierarchically hyperbolic groups admit a unique action which is the largest in this poset. The action we construct is also universal in the sense that every element which acts loxodromically in some acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space does so in this one. Special cases of this result are themselves new and interesting. For instance, this is the first proof that right-angled Coxeter groups admit universal acylindrical actions.             The notion of quasigeodesic stability of subgroups provides a natural analogue of quasiconvexity which can be considered outside the context of hyperbolic groups. In this paper, we provide a complete classification of stable subgroups of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, generalizing and extending results that are known in the context of mapping class groups and right-angled Artin groups. Along the way, we provide a characterization of contracting quasigeodesics; interestingly, in this generality the proof is much simpler than in the special cases where it was already known.                            In the appendix, it is verified that any space satisfying the               a priori               weaker property of being an ``almost hierarchically hyperbolic space'' is actually a hierarchically hyperbolic space. The results of the appendix are used to streamline the proofs in the main text.},

Classical properties of P in G correspond to topological or geometric properties of K(G, P), such as having finite height, having finite width, being almost malnormal, admiting a malnormal core, or having thickness of order one. As applications, we obtain that a number of algebraic properties of P in G are quasi-isometry invariants of the pair (G, P).

In genus at least three, there are no known infinite hyperbolic quotients of mapping class groups. However, using the hierarchically hyperbolic quotients we construct, we show, under a residual finiteness assumption, that mapping class groups have many nonelementary hyperbolic quotients.

We prove the equivalence of two definitions of this notion. One is essentially that of a group admitting a properly discontinuous geometrically finite action on a proper hyperbolic space, that is, such that every limit point is either a conical limit point or a bounded parabolic point. The other is that of a group which admits a cofinite action on a connected fine hyperbolic graph. We define a graph to be "fine" if there are only finitely many circuits a given length containing any given edge, and we develop some of the properties of this notion. We show how a relatively hyperbolic group can be assumed to act on a proper hyperbolic space of a particular geometric form. We define the boundary of a relatively hyperbolic group, and show that the limit set of any geometrically finite action of the group is equivariantly homeomorphic to this boundary. This generalizes a result of Tukia for geometrically finite kleinian groups. We also describe when the boundary is connected.},

  abstract = {Gridworlds have been long-utilised in AI research, particularly in reinforcement learning, as they provide simple yet scalable models for many real-world applications such as robot navigation, emergent behaviour, and operations research. We initiate a study of gridworlds using the mathematical framework of reconfigurable systems and state complexes due to Abrams, Ghrist \& Peterson. State complexes, a higher-dimensional analogue of state graphs, represent all possible configurations of a system as a single geometric space, thus making them conducive to study using geometric, topological, or combinatorial methods. The main contribution of this work is a modification to the original Abrams, Ghrist \& Peterson setup which we introduce to capture agent braiding and thereby more naturally represent the topology of gridworlds. With this modification, the state complexes may exhibit geometric defects (failure of Gromov's Link Condition). Serendipitously, we discover these failures for agent-only cases occur exactly where undesirable or dangerous states appear in the gridworld. Our results therefore provide a novel method for seeking guaranteed safety limitations in discrete task environments with single or multiple agents, and offer useful safety information (in geometric and topological forms) for incorporation in or analysis of machine learning systems. More broadly, our work introduces tools from geometric group theory and combinatorics to the AI community and demonstrates a proof-of-concept for this geometric viewpoint of the task domain through the example of simple environments.},

Many different kinds of dynamical structures (e.g. taut foliations, quasigeodesic or pseudo-Anosov flows) are known to give rise to universal circles -- a circle with a faithful \$\textbackslash pi\_1(M)\$ action preserving a pair of invariant laminations -- and these universal circles play a key role in relating the dynamical structure to the geometry of \$M\$. In this paper we introduce the idea of zippers, which give a new and direct way to construct universal circles, streamlining the known constructions in many cases, and giving a host of new constructions in others. In particular, zippers (and their associated universal circles) may be constructed directly from uniform quasimorphisms or from uniform left orders.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the question of relative hyperbolicity of an Artin group with regard to the geometry of its associated Deligne complex. We prove that an Artin group is weakly hyperbolic relative to its finite (or spherical) type parabolic subgroups if and only if its Deligne complex is a Gromov hyperbolic space. For a two-dimensional Artin group the Deligne complex is Gromov hyperbolic precisely when the corresponding Davis complex is Gromov hyperbolic, that is, precisely when the underlying Coxeter group is a hyperbolic group. For Artin groups of FC type we give a sufficient condition for hyperbolicity of the Deligne complex which applies to a large class of these groups for which the underlying Coxeter group is hyperbolic. The key tool in the proof is an extension of the Milnor-Svarc Lemma which states that if a group G admits a discontinuous, co-compact action by isometries on a Gromov hyperbolic metric space, then G is weakly hyperbolic relative to the isotropy subgroups of the action.},

Other examples can be found among groups acting geometrically on \$CAT(0)\$ spaces, fundamental groups of graphs of groups, etc. We obtain a number of general results about rotating families and hyperbolically embedded subgroups; although our technique applies to a wide class of groups, it is capable of producing new results even for well-studied particular classes.

We first establish a full measure equivalence classification of graph products of countably infinite groups over finite simple graphs with no transvection and no partial conjugation. This finds applications to their classification up to commensurability, and up to isomorphism, and to the study of their automorphism groups. We also derive structural properties of von Neumann algebras associated to probability measure-preserving actions of graph products. Variations of the measure equivalence classification statement are given with fewer assumptions on the defining graphs. We also provide a quantified version of our measure equivalence classification theorem, that keeps track of the integrability of associated cocycles. As an application, we solve an inverse problem in quantitative orbit equivalence for a large family of right-angled Artin groups. We then establish several rigidity theorems. First, in the spirit of work of Monod-Shalom, we achieve rigidity in orbit equivalence for probability measure-preserving actions of graph products, upon imposing extra ergodicity assumptions. Second, we establish a sufficient condition on the defining graph and on the vertex groups ensuring that a graph product G is rigid in measure equivalence among torsion-free groups (in the sense that every torsion-free countable group H which is measure equivalent to G, is in fact isomorphic to G). Using variations over the Higman groups as the vertex groups, we construct the first example of a group which is rigid in measure equivalence, but not in quasi-isometry, among torsion-free groups.},

In particular, for 3 g - 3 + p {$\leq$} 2, we show that the mapping class group \$MCG(\textbackslash Sigma \_\textbraceleft g,p\textbraceright )\$ is fully residually non-elementary hyperbolic and admits an affine isometric action with unbounded orbits on some \$L\textasciicircum q\$ space. Moreover, if every hyperbolic group is residually finite, then every convex-cocompact subgroup of \$MCG(\textbackslash Sigma \_\textbraceleft g,p\textbraceright )\$ is separable. The aforementioned results follow from general theorems about composite rotating families, in the sense of [13], that come from a collection of subgroups of vertex stabilizers for the action of a group G on a hyperbolic graph X . We give conditions ensuring that the graph X / N is again hyperbolic and various properties of the action of G on X persist for the action of G / N on X / N .},

  abstract = {The first author and Oguni introduced a class of groups of non-positive curvature, called coarsely convex group. The recent success of the theory of groups which are hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups has motivated the study of other properties of groups from the relative perspective. In this article, we propose definitions for the notions of weakly semihyperbolic, semihyperbolic, and coarsely convex group pairs extending the corresponding notions in the non-relative case. The main result of this article is the following combination theorem. Let \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft A\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft wsh\textbraceright\$, \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft A\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft sh\textbraceright\$, and \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft A\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft gcc\textbraceright\$ denote the classes of group pairs that are weakly semihyperbolic, semihyperbolic, and geodesic coarsely convex respectively. Let \$\textbackslash mathcal A\$ be one of the classes \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft A\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft wsh\textbraceright\$, \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft A\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft sh\textbraceright\$, and \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft A\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft gcc\textbraceright\$. Let \$G\$ be a group that splits as a finite graph of groups such that each vertex group \$G\_v\$ is assigned a finite collection of subgroups \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft H\textbraceright\_v\$, and each edge group \$G\_e\$ is conjugate to a subgroup of some \$H\textbackslash in \textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft H\textbraceright\_v\$ if \$e\$ is adjacent to \$v\$. Then there is a non-trivial finite collection of subgroups \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft H\textbraceright\$ of \$G\$ satisfying the following properties. If each \$(G\_v, \textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft H\textbraceright\_v)\$ is in \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft A\textbraceright{} \$, then \$(G,\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft H\textbraceright )\$ is in \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft A\textbraceright\$.

Invented in the 16th century, and practiced to its fullest extent by a German sociologist who wrote more than seventy books and hundreds of articles, the Zettelkasten method is exploding in popularity. Writers of all types are discovering that digital tools make the method more powerful than ever, turning your digital life into an ``external brain,'' or ``bicycle for the mind.''In Digital Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods, \& Examples, blogger and nonfiction author David Kadavy shares a first-principles approach on how to adapt the Zettelkasten method to simple digital tools of your choice. How to structure your Zettelkasten? Kadavy borrows an element of the Getting Things Done framework to make sure nothing you want to read falls through the cracks. Naming convention pros/cons. Should you adopt the classic ``Folgezettel'' technique, or do digital tools make it irrelevant for your workflow? Reading workflow. The exact steps to follow to turn what you read into detailed notes you can mix and match to produce writing. Staying comfortable. Build a workflow to maintain your Zettelkasten without being chained to your computer. Examples, examples, examples. See real examples of notes that illustrate concepts, so you can build a Zettelkasten that fits your workflow and tools. Digital Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods, \& Examples is short, to the point, with no fluff, so it won't keep you from what you want -- to build your Zettelkasten!},

It is not hard to see that the complex is finite-dimensional, but locally infinite. It was introduced by Harvey as an analogy, in the context of Teichmuller space, for Tits buildings for symmetric spaces, and has been studied by Harer and Ivanov as a tool for understanding mapping class groups of surfaces. In this paper we prove that, endowed with a natural metric, the complex is hyperbolic in the sense of Gromov. In a certain sense this hyperbolicity is an explanation of why the Teichmuller space has some negative-curvature properties in spite of not being itself hyperbolic: Hyperbolicity in the Teichmuller space fails most obviously in the regions corresponding to surfaces where some curve is extremely short. The complex of curves exactly encodes the intersection patterns of this family of regions (it is the "nerve" of the family), and we show that its hyperbolicity means that the Teichmuller space is "relatively hyperbolic" with respect to this family. A similar relative hyperbolicity result is proved for the mapping class group of a surface. We also show that the action of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes on the complex is hyperbolic, with a uniform bound on translation distance.},

  abstract = {In this paper a group theoretic version of Dehn surgery is studied. Starting with an arbitrary relatively hyperbolic group G we define a peripheral filling procedure, which produces quotients of G by imitating the effect of the Dehn filling of a complete finite volume hyperbolic 3--manifold M on the fundamental group {$\pi$}1(M ). The main result of the paper is an algebraic counterpart of Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem. We also show that peripheral subgroups of G `almost' have the Congruence Extension Property and the group G is approximated (in an algebraic sense) by its quotients obtained by peripheral fillings.},

We investigate quasiconvex subsets in this class and characterize them in terms of their contracting properties, relative divergence, the coarse median structure, and the hierarchical structure itself. Along the way, we obtain new tools to study HHSs which include two new equivalent definitions of hierarchical quasiconvexiy, and a version of the bounded geodesic image property for quasiconvex subsets. Utilizing our characterization, we prove that the hyperbolically embedded subgroups of hierarchically hyperbolic groups are precisely those which are almost malnormal and quasiconvex, producing a new result in the case of the mapping class group. We also apply our characterization to study quasiconvex subsets in several specific examples of HHSs. We show that while many commonly studied HHSs have the property that that every quasiconvex subset is either hyperbolic or coarsely covers the entire space, right-angled Coxeter groups exhibit a wide variety of quasiconvex subsets.}

Sticking out of the man's book is a notecard with scribblings of his thoughts. On the floor next to the man sit piles of books and journal articles. The room's walls are bookshelves stocked with 11,000 titles of books, journals, and manuscripts. Yet the object drawing the most attention today is the thing resting on the floor next to the man's desk: a wooden notebox cabinet containing twenty-four drawers. This object, known in German as a 'Zettelkasten', translates to "notebox." This notebox has attracted fascination in recent years. People hold this man's mysterious notebox system as the "secret" to how this sociologist was so productive. And indeed, this man was productive. Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998) produced six-hundred academic papers and seventy books in approximately forty years (an astonishing amount). Unfortunately, as it stands today, Luhmann's notebox system is widely misunderstood. Many have developed their own interpretations of how it works. These Zettelkasten teachings are littered with phrases Luhmann never used, and rules Luhmann himself never even abided by! Furthermore, much of the system's "magic" has been lost in a makeshift attempt to export it into the digital age. In this book, Scott P. Scheper dives into the original nature of Luhmann's Zettelkasten: the analog version. Scheper uncovers four principles Luhmann identified that make it unique. This system (called an "Antinet Zettelkasten") contains many overlooked elements that made Luhmann's system so effective. After finishing this book, you will have an advanced understanding of the powerful knowledge system that will transform you into a more prolific learner, reader, researcher, and writer"--Back cover.},

  abstract = {A lot has happened in the world of digital design since the first edition of this title was published, but one thing remains true: There is an ever-growing number of people attempting to design pages with no formal training. This book is the one place they can turn to find quick, non-intimidating, excellent design help from trusted design instructor Robin Williams. This revised classic--now in full color--includes a new section on the hot topic of Color itself. In The Non-Designer's Design Book, 3rd Editio n, Robin turns her attention to the basic principles that govern good design. Readers who follow her clearly explained concepts will produce more sophisticated and professional pages immediately. Humor-infused, jargon-free prose interspersed with design exercises, quizzes, and illustrations make learning a snap--which is just what audiences have come to expect from this best-selling author},

  abstract = {"This monograph weaves together fundamentals of Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov's hyperbolic groups with the theory of cube complexes dual to spaces with walls. Many fundamental new ideas and methodologies are presented here for the first time: A cubical small-cancellation theory generalizing ideas from the 1960's, a version of "Dehn Filling" that works in the category of special cube complexes, and a variety of new results about right-angled Artin groups. The book culminates by providing an unexpected new theorem about the nature of hyperbolic groups that are constructible as amalgams. Among the stunning applications, are the virtual fibering of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the resolution of R.J. Baumslag's conjecture on the residual finiteness of one-relator groups with torsion. Most importantly, the book outlines the author's program towards the resolution of the most important remaining conjectures of William Thurston, and achieves substantial progress in this direction. This monograph, which is richly illustrated with over 100 drawings, will be of interest to graduate students and scholars working in geometry, algebra, and topology. This groundbreaking monograph, intended for the Annals of Math series, lays the mathematical groundwork for the solution of the Thurston-Haken Conjecture, a significant result in geometric group theory. It outlines one of the deepest and most surprising pieces of this result, which also has a variety of other implications for geometric group theory. This work also has applications to low-dimensional topology, and the results in this book have since been used by other mathematicians to provide other important results"--},
